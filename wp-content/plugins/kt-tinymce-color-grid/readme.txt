Take full control over color pickers of TinyMCE and the palette of the Theme Customizer. Create a central color palette for an uniform look'n'feel!

== Description ==

This plugin replaces the color picker for choosing a text or background color found inside the TinyMCE toolbar with a bigger and customizable color grid. The palette of the color picker found especially in the Theme Customizer can also be set through a central palette. You can define this central color palette through the settings menu. All plugins that make use of WordPress' color picker can benefit from this plugin as well.

**New since 1.8:** All settings and your palette can now be exported to a file and imported back into WordPress.
